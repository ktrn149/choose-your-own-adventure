		<p>You decided to examine the bird.<br><br>It is a species of bird you have never seen before.  It tilts its head at you and makes a small noise.  You turn and see a small box on a table.  You see that it has bird food inside, and you feed some to the bird.  As you are doing so, the door opens and an elderly woman comes in with several suitcases.  "Oh dear", she exclaims.  "Thank you for taking care of Peep.  I missed him so much."  She rushes to the bird cage, takes out the bird, and puts it on her shoulder.  She turns to you.  "You have done a fine job of taking care of him.  The next time I travel to Paris for a week, you'll be the first person I call!"  She opens her purse and takes out a pen and checkbook.  "This is for your trouble," she whispers as she places the check in your hand.  "I'll have Louis drive you home.  He's waiting downstairs."  You leave the apartment in shock, gingerly holding a check for $5,000.  Spontaneously sitting on that magical chair might have been the best thing you've done all day.</p>
