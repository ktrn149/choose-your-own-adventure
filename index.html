		<p>It's an normal Saturday afternoon, and you decide to walk into the local thrift store to see what's new.  You walk down the aisles, and arrive at a display in the corner.  A red hat and brown chair rest on a ratty old rug.  A sign above says, "You have the power to change your destiny.  Great riches or amazing adventures await!  Choose."  Well, you consider, you didn't have any else going on today, so you are willing to give one of them a shot.  Now, which one will you choose?</p>
