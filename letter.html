		<p>You decided to read the paper.<br><br>It is a letter, written to you. It says that you are in purgatory, and you can only leave the room if you beg forgiveness for one terrible sin you commited when you were alive.  You wrack your brain, trying to remember what you possibly could have done to deserve this.  Time passes, but you have no way of knowing how long you have been there.  Your mind begins to deteriate and your mental condition unravels.  Your last conscious thought before decending into madness is that the letter lied to you...you are not in pergatory.  You are actually in hell.</p>
