		<p>You decided to look out the window.<br><br>You see that you are surrounded by other tall buildings, which have sustained heavy damage.  You hear guns going off in the distance, and see dark airplanes flying overhead.  In the street below, you see several groups of men running with guns, wearing helmets and trench coats.  You suddenly realize that you have been transported to Europe during World War 2.  You have no idea where you are, or what year it is, but a dreaded realization dawns on you: you may not make it out alive.</p>
