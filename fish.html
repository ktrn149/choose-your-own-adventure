		<p>You decided to use the baseball bat for getting fish.<br><br>You go out into the surf and start looking for fish.  You find a particularly big one and you hit it with your bat.  You take it to the shore and begin taking it apart.  To your surprise, you find a fully charged satellite phone inside.  You call in a rescue, get saved, and swear off magical items forever.</p>
