		<p>You decided to take the machete.<br><br>You quickly realize that your situation is dire.  You have no food or shelter, and the weather is very hot.  There are few resources on the island, but you notice two things in abundance: turtles and trees.  You have to get moving fast.  Utilizing your machete on both resources will take up valuble time, so you decide to focus your energy on just one of them.</p>
