		<p>You decided to leave the room.<br><br>You begin to walk down flights of stairs, wondering what just happened.  You remember sitting in a chair at the thrift store, and the next thing you remember is appearing in a strange deserted room.  You saved a bird from certain death, but what does that mean?  Was it all a dream?  Did you just drink too much last night?  As you stumble through the building lobby and out into the bright morning sunlight, you consider your past decisons and consider what happened that brought you into this strange situation.  You walk the streets, trying to get your bearings.  You walk past an elderly man sitting in a newstand.  Hoping to get information on where you are, you pear closely at the newspaper.  However, one small detail grabs your attention immediately.  The date on the newspaper is September 10, 2001.</p>
