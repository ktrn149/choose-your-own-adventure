		<p>You decided to take the baseball bat.<br><br>You quickly realize that your situation is dire.  You have no water and no food, and the weather is very hot.  There are few resources on the island, but you notice two things in abundance: fish and coconuts.  You have to get moving fast.  Utilizing your baseball bat on both resources will take up valuble time, so you decide to focus your energy on just one of them.</p>
