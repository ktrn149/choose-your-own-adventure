		<p>You decided to use the machete to build a hut.<br><br>You go out and start choping sticks, and collecting palm fronds.  Soon, you have a rudimentary shelter.  It's effective at keeping the sun off of you, and you have some relief from the winds.  As the days pass by, you spend your time killing fish and birds.  You feel your body getting thinner and weaker.  One night, a strong storm comes to the island and wrecks your hut, leaving you cold and wet.  As you ponder your worsening situation, your eyes keep getting drawn to the machete, and its sharp metal edge.</p>
